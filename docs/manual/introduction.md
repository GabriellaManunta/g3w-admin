# Introduction

G3W-SUITE is a **modular client-server application for the management and publication of interactive map projects**.

Its development was born from the need to have a software capable of **publishing, in total autonomy and quickly and easily on a webgis client, QGIS cartographic projects**.

The need to have a management application to be inserted in structured contexts such as public bodies, parks, companies, etc. was the engine that led to develop aspects related to:
      
 * **organization of cartographic contents in a hierarchical way**: macro groups and cartographic groups
 * **access control systems** for administration and consultation of projects
 * **editing functionality and access of the various dedicated modules** based on an editable and configurable user profiling system, also of a hierarchical type
