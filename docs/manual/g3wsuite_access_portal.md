Most of the information shown in the access portal can be defined from the **Configurations -> Edit General Data session**, accessible from the icon located in the upper right corner of the Administration Panel.

### What's this
The **What is** session shows a series of basic information relating to the structure responsible for the Cartographic Portal.

### Maps
By accessing the **Maps** session, the individual **Macrogroups** (if present) will be displayed, access to the Macrogroup will allow you to view the associated **Cartographic Groups** and from these access the list of individual **WebGis services**.

The MacroGroups, Groups and WebGis services listed will be those defined as free access.

If you have a user for access, you can authenticate yourself through the **Access** session and by entering the **user and password** in your possession.

Following authentication, the **Maps** page will also show the MacroGroups, Groups and WebGis services with restricted access and on which the user has access permissions.
