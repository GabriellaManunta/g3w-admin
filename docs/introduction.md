# Introduction

**G3W-SUITE is a modular client-server application for the management and publication of interactive map projects.**

The framework was born from the need to have a software capable of **publishing, in total autonomy and in a simple and fast way on a webgis client, cartographic projects realized with [QGIS](https://qgis.org).**

The following aspects will be analyzed within the manual:
* **organization and optimization of data and QGIS projects for web publishing**
* **organization of cartographic contents in a hierarchical way: macro groups and cartographic groups**
* **user management and access control systems for consultation and management of webgis services**
* **management of the online editing function for the creation of web cartographic management systems**

**The current release is compatible with `QGIS 3.4 LTR`.(Server and Desktop).**

The next version (whose release is scheduled for **July 2020**) will be compatible with **`QGIS 3.10 LTR`**.
